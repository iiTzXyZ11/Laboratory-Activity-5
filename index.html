                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>I am Klyne Xyril M. Africano, a first-year BS Computer Application student at MSU-IIT. I’m currently building my foundation in programming, problem-solving, and technology as I continue my academic journey. Beyond academics, I have a strong interest in trading and market analysis, constantly learning how financial markets work and developing strategies to make informed decisions. Combining my passion for technology with my curiosity for finance, I strive to enhance both my technical skills and analytical thinking as I work toward my personal and professional goals.</p>

                    <h1>Early Life</h1>
                    <p>I was born in Ozamiz City but grew up moving between several cities, including Cebu, Iligan, and back to Ozamiz. I have always been fascinated by computers. Even as a child, I was more interested in understanding how they worked than in playing the games they offered. This early curiosity led me to explore technology in every way I could, tinkering with gadgets and attempting to fix devices—even when I had little knowledge of how they functioned. My natural inclination to experiment and problem-solve from a young age sparked a lifelong interest in technology and the skills needed to navigate it.</p></div>
